/*
 * Alan tries to fall asleep by counting 'electric sheep'.
 * For any nth sheep, if n is even then Alan counts n in decimal.
 * Otherwise, it is an electric sheep and he counts n in binary.
 * For example, Alan would count eight sheep as follows:
 *
 *     0 sheep, 1 sheep, 2 sheep, 11 sheep, 4 sheep, 101 sheep, 6 sheep, 111 sheep, 8 sheep
 *
 * Using a while loop and if statements, write a program that will print Alan's counting while he is awake.
 * The loop should stop when Alan falls asleep.
 * Usually he falls asleep when he reaches a count of ten.
 *
 * The following code will convert an integer into a binary string.
 *
 *        int num = 40;
 *        String binary = Integer.toBinaryString(num);
